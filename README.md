**Customer Satisfaction Prediction Web App**

This Flask-based web application aims to gather customer feedback and predict satisfaction using a pre-trained machine learning model. Users can complete a form with various satisfaction metrics, which the model then uses to make predictions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Feedback Form**: Users can input their feedback.
2. **Prediction Engine**: The model predicts customer satisfaction based on the provided inputs.
3. **Data Storage**: Customer feedback is stored in an SQLite database for future reference.

**Technologies Utilized:**

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **SQLite**: A compact database engine for storing customer feedback.
- **Joblib**: Used to load the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for building the frontend interface.
